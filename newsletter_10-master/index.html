						<h3>Background</h3>
            <p>Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Tunnel, the first underwater tunnel in South Asia. 
              Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Tunnel, in short, Bangabandhu Tunnel or Karnaphuli Tunnel, 
              is an under-construction underwater expressway tunnel in the port city of Chattogram, 
              Bangladesh under the Karnaphuli River. The length of the main tunnel is 3.32km, 
              with each tube measuring 2.45km at a diameter of 10.80 metres. Each tube will have two lanes, 
              with connecting roads for the main tunnel and a 727-metre over-bridge. Located at the river
              mouth in Chittagong, the tunnel is 9.3km long, in which the length of the tunnel shield 
              section is 2,450m while the tunnel outer diameter is 11.8m. The 3,400-meter-long tunnel 
              project is being constructed at a cost of around Tk 10,000 crore which will be open to 
              public and vehicles by December 2022.</p>

                <p>Chittagong, located at the southeast coast of Bangladesh, is the main sea port and 
                  largest commercial city of the country. Most of the export and import activities of 
                  the country are being carried out through Chittagong Port situated in the mouth of the 
                  Karnaphuli River. The Karnaphuli divides Chittagong City into two parts. The northwest 
                  part is confined to the city and the port and the southeast part is the area of heavy 
                  industries. Current two bridges are not sufficient to accommodate the existing and 
                  increasing huge traffic flow. Due to river morphology, siltation on the river bed of the 
                  Karnaphuli is a major problem and the threat for proper functioning of the Chittagong Port. 
                  To face the problem of siltation, Bangladesh Bridge Authority (BBA) intends to construct 
                  a multi-lane road tunnel crossing the Karnaphuli river instead of construction of another 
                  bridge over the same river.

                  Bangladesh Bridge Authority was entrusted to implement the project. China Communication 
                  Construction Company Ltd. jointly ventured with Ove Arup and Partners Hong Kong Ltd. 
                  (CCCC-Arup JV, the Consultant) was awarded to implement the project. The DeVCon 
                  (a national consulting firm) has been engaged as the nominated sub-consultant to support

                <h3>Geotechnical Point of view of Karnaphuli Tunnel</h3> 

                  <p>
                    Chittagong is the major port city and the gateway of Bangladesh. It is also the second 
                    largest city and the<i><b>“commercial capital” </b></i>of the country. The Karnaphuli 
                    River divides Chittagong City into two parts. One part is confined to the city and the port, 
                    the other part is the area of heavy industry.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Geologically the area falls within the Bengal Foredeep of Bengal Basin where Neogene sediments 
                    with alternation of shale and sandstone are well developed. The general elevation of the 
                    investigated area ranges from -8.8 to 4.395 m. Due to river morphology, siltation on the bed 
                    of the Karnaphuli River is a big problem and the major threat for proper functioning of the 
                    Chittagong Port. To face the problem of siltation, Bangladesh Bridge Authority (BBA) intends 
                    to construct a tunnel crossing the Karnaphuli River instead of construction of another bridge
                    over the same river.

                  <h3>Physical Description</h3>
                    <p>
                      Seven (7) boreholes were drilled along the proposed tunnel alignment. Boreholes were arranged 
                      along the proposed tunnel axis on both sides of the river. Borehole locations were considered
                      at an interval of 300-500m with simple engineering geological conditions while at an interval 
                      of 100-300m with complicated engineering geological conditions.

                <h3>Delivering for the community</h3>
                <p>
                  The Karnaphuli Tunnel is a game changer for the southeast region of Bangladesh, presenting a 
                  solution to connectivity issues to the rest of the country. Upon its completion in 2022, 
                  the tunnel will form another link in the connection between North and Southeast Asia. It is 
                  also part of China’s One Belt One Road initiative (OBOR) and a key link in planned cross-country
                  transport corridors.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Along with the Chittagong Outer Ring Road and the Dhaka Chattogram Expressway – both of which 
                  were designed by SMEC – the Karnaphuli Tunnel is poised to be a catalyst for the economic 
                  transformation of southeast Bangladesh into an industrial hub. The economy of Bangladesh will 
                  receive a significant boost once the tunnel is constructed, creating major employment 
                  opportunities for the region.
                </p>
                <br>

                <h3>Opportunities</h3>
                <p>
                  A mega construction of new roads, approach roads, industries and tourism facilities are on 
                  their triumphant march centering the much-hyped Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Tunnel 
                  aiming to transform the landscape of the port city.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Bangladesh Bridge Authority (BBA) says the tunnel will connect Anwara with the port city 
                  and reduce 50-kilometre distance from the capital Dhaka and 15-kilometre from Chattogram to 
                  tourism capital Cox’s Bazar. It will connect Anwara to Patenga near Shah Amanat International 
                  Airport and Chattogram Port in the metropolis as well. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  The government plans to expand the port city on both sides of the river as 
                  “One City,Two-Town Model” much like Shanghai in China.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The underground passageway is a significant part of the world longest Super Marine Drive from 
                  Mirsrai to Teknaf and Asian Highway connecting Chttogram port and Matarbari deep seaport.

                  <p>With the construction of the tunnel, the Anwara-Karnaphuli area will take a new look. 
                    From the Anwara intersection of the tunnel and from the area adjacent to Parki sea beach 
                    to Shah Amanat Bridge under the Karnaphuli upazila area, a 12-kilometre-long area along 
                    the bank of Karnaphuli River witnesses a series of construction work by government, 
                    private and foreign agencies.</p>

                  <dd><h3 style="font-size: 15px;">A city plan is underway</h3></dd>
                  <p>The industrial hub Chattogram stands on the north side of Karnaphuli River that generates 
                    40 percent of industrial production which is the gateway to 80 percent of international trade 
                    and 50 percent of revenue collection.</p>
                  <p>With an almost 2.25 percent yearly average urban population growth, the city will be a home 
                    to seven million people by 2035, according to the United Nations Urbanisation 
                    Prospect report 2018.  </p>

                  <dd><h3 style="font-size: 15px;">Socio-Economic Development</h3></dd>
                  <p>Dr Atiur Rahman, former governor of Bangladesh Bank and eminent economist, told the 
                    Bangladesh Post, “Tunnels are more cost-effective than bridges. This will reduce the cost 
                    of travel both for individual and commercial vehicles. The value addition to the economy 
                    can be substantial. I haven’t calculated the value addition, but there will be huge gains 
                    in terms of GDP,” he added. </p>
                  <p>
                    The economists said the special economic zones in the region will also benefit hugely 
                    from the tunnel in terms of better forward and backward linkages.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “While these mega infrastructures will take the country to a new trajectory of higher 
                    growth, the challenges remain: who will run them? The quality of human resources will 
                    have to be vastly improved by injecting more skills into it,” he said. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Atiur suggested restructuring of the education system to produce quality human resources 
                    which can take advantage of these infrastructures and make the economy more productive. 
                    “The productivity gains must be at the heart of our drive for a new trajectory of growth 
                    supported by these mega infrastructures,” he said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    At last, The tunnel will greatly improve the development of the regional economy in 
                    Bangladesh as well as play an important role in interconnectivity between Bangladesh 
                    and its neighboring countries.

          <h3>Light at the end of Karnaphuli tunnel</h3>
          <p>The Bangabandhu Tunnel under the river Karnaphuli, first of a kind in Bangladesh is 
            expected to be open for vehicular movements next year, and it could even be well 
            ahead of the scheduled time of December 2022.</p>
          <br>
           
          <h3>Bangabandhu Tunnel work in full swing</h3> 

              <p>
                Work to build the country's first underwater expressway tunnel - Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur 
                Rahman Tunnel - under Karnaphuli River is going on in full swing, with around 62 percent of 
                work already completed, according to officials. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Although pace of work was a bit slow in the second quarter of last year due to the pandemic, 
                it has been ramped up to complete the project by December, 2022, said project sources
              </p><br />

            <h3>Amazing progress made in Karnaphuli tunnel’s construction work</h3>
                <p>
                  We are delighted to learn that the construction work of the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur 
                  Rahman Tunnel under the river Karnaphuli, the first of its kind in South Asia, has been 
                  progressing at such a rapid pace that the authorities are hoping to open it to traffic

            <h3>Karnaphuli tunnel excavation to end before deadline</h3>
            <p>
              While work on the excavation for the first tube of the Karnaphuli tunnel was delayed by 
              the pandemic, faster efforts for the second tube have made up for the crucial lost time 
              as its boring is expected to end this Friday – nearly two months ahead of schedule.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h3>Karnaphuli tunnel is 75% complete. Now the project is dogged by potential trouble: traffic jam</h3>
            <p>
              The authorities have completed almost three-quarters of the work to construct a tunnel 
              beneath the Karnaphuli River in Chattogram four years after the launch of the project. 
              They are now exploring ways to deal with possible traffic congestions at both ends of 
              the structure in the long run….
            </p>
            <br>

            <h3>Karnaphuli tunnel to unlock trade potential</h3>
            <p>
              The under construction Karnaphuli River tunnel is going to represent a watershed in 
              the lives of people in the port city who have long been dreaming to connect to the 
              southern part of the ‘S’-shaped river.
            </p>

            <h3>Karnaphuli Tunnel opening before deadline</h3>
            <p>
              One of the mega projects of the government, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Tunnel 
              beneath the Karnaphuli River is going one step further towards completion. The second 
              mouth of the tunnel will be opened.
            </p>
